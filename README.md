# PlainClarizen
Application to convert [Clarizen Entities](http://www.clarizen.com/) to Plain Old CLR Objects. Please see [Instructions](https://github.com/garfbradaz/PlainClarizen/blob/master/docs/instructions.md) on how to use.

This application is powered by :

* [Xamasofts](http://www.xamasoft.com/) own Open Source [JSON to C# Library](http://www.xamasoft.com/) on Codeplex.I have made a couple of amendments to allow inherited classes, but nothing major.
* My own [Clarizen.Net](https://github.com/garfbradaz/clarizen.net)
