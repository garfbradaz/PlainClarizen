#Instructions

This is while I get the code shaped ready for beta:

1. Download the code.
2. You need to add your own Username and Password for your Clarizen System here:

```C#
RestClient client = new RestClient("username", "password");
```

3. Compile the solution.
4. Run it! Follow the instructions to bring down your own implementation (Custom Fields from Clarizen etc).
